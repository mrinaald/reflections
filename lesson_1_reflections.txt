How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It shows the lines together in which the changes had come, with the '-'(minus) sign for the line in
the first file and a '+'(plus) sign for the line in the changed file. This provides an easy 
comparison when viewed with our eyes.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can easily check where we have gone wrong in the newer versions of the code easily by comparison.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
